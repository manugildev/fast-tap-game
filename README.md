Fast Tap! is a highly addictive game where you have to tap all the buttons with the same color as the indicator shows. This game is made in Java using Android Studio since Google is not supporting Eclipse anymore (you can import on Eclipse). The game has been made using LibGDX framework which is also made in pure java.

Fast Tap! has been designed so you can change anything in the game, the buttons, fonts, sounds, all images and colors that I used to make it...
We have created a Configuration File where you can change all the values in code, and see the result on your game, there you can find all the ids that need to be changed.

The online documentation will be updated with the questions of the buyers, to make it even better than it is now.
Comes with Admob banners and interstitial ready. It also has youtube tutorials in order to customize and import the game.
